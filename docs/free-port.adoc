== Introduction

Sometimes we want a free port in our tests so that we can either start a server on it or
to test a failure scenario when there is no service at given port.

It's a JUnit Jupiter extension which provides a free port for above-mentioned use cases.
Also, there is no guarantee that the port will still be available by the time you use it.

NOTE: You can retry the test in such cases based on `FreePort.isFreeNow`

== Usage

To get the `FreePort` as an argument on a test just add the annotation to your test suite as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
include::{demo}[tag=basic_free_port_example]
